<h1>GENREFICATION</h1>
<h2>What is Genrefication?</h2>
  <p><strong><em>Genrefication</em></strong> is a library classification system in which books are evaluated 
    based on the <strong>thematic contents of the story</strong> and placed into genre categories. To put it simply, genrefication is a way to divide books by the types of stories they are
    in order to make it easy to find books that are alike!</p>

  <p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> Genrefication is also called the "Bookstore Model," because sorting books by thematic content is how most bookstores are organized. 
    By implementing genres in library classification, library users benefit from having an system similar to a bookstore where it's easy to browse and discover new books to read,
    while maintaining other elements of traditional library classification like call numbers to make items easy to organize and locate. </p>

<h2>Benefits of Genrefication:</h2>

    <li>Assists readers in identifying books that <strong>align with their interests</strong>.</li>
    <li>Gives readers the <strong>language to describe types of books</strong> and what they like about them.</li>
    <li>Helps readers be <strong>more independent in locating books</strong> by placing similar stories together.</li>
    <li>Makes <strong>readers' advisory easier</strong> by physically grouping books by thematic contents.</li>
    <li><strong>Increases circulation</strong> of books overall.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Background of Our Decision to Genrefy</h2>
  <p>Before genrefication, Birch Lake Media Center organized all its books solely by the Dewey Decimal Classification system. 
    Since its creation in the late 1800s, Dewey has been the most prominant library classification system used in school and public libraries.
    While Dewey is best known for its numeric classification of non-fiction books in a logical order according to subject and content, 
    all fiction books in Dewey are arranged only by the letters of the author's last name. This means that books are placed on the shelf alphabetically with no regard to the content of the book.</p>
  
  <p>In order to better meet the needs of students, many media centers are now moving to genrefication as a classification system that can either be used in conjunction with the 
    Dewey or alone to group books by content within the fiction section. Birch Lake Elementary will be the last school library in the district to genrefy its fiction
    section, and the genres displayed on this website reflect the same genres used throughout the White Bear Lake Area School District. </p>
